# Artist Portal

## A non political, organic music showcase for aspiring artist.

### Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to allow artist to upload their music and showcase it.

This differs a couple ways from existing platforms.
- The platform is very simple and clean.
- Zero clutter from ads.
- Organic positioning. ( You can't pay your way to the top )
- Zero politics.

### How it works:
* Artist:

Signup with Facebook. Upload your songs with an MP3, a cover image and the title of the song. Your song is automatically placed in the pool of music. If a fan likes your song all they have to do is click the like button. As your song gets more likes it moves up in the pool. This is the only way for your song to move up. Each fan can like each song one time.

* Fans:

Signup with Facebook. Listen to new music and show your love for a song by clicking the like button. You can only like a song one time. Every song that you like will show up in your dashboard for your convenience.
